Thes stills are from a 4K scan of *A Trip Down Market Street Before the Fire* (April 1906), sourced from the Prelinger Archives (public domain). Full footage available [here](https://archive.org/details/MarketStreet19064KScan20181016).

The original footage was filmed by the Miles Brothers on April 14, 1906, just days before the San Francisco earthquake and fire of April 1906.

The exact date of filming for A Trip is a bit debated among historians, but the most widely accepted date is April 14, 1906. Here’s why:

*Evidence for April 14, 1906*
- **Historical Records**: The Miles Brothers, who filmed it, are documented to have shot the footage on a streetcar traveling down Market Street in San Francisco a few days before the April 18, 1906, earthquake and fire. April 14 is frequently cited in archival sources, including notes from the Prelinger Archives and the Library of Congress.
- **Film Analysis**: Researchers like David Kiehn (from the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum) analyzed details in the footage—such as newspapers visible on newsstands, weather conditions, and street activity—and concluded April 14, 1906, fits best. This was detailed in a 2009 article in the San Francisco Chronicle and subsequent studies.
- **Prelinger Archives Context**: The film’s significance is tied to its timing just before the disaster, and April 14 aligns with the timeline of the Miles Brothers’ work.
